# Breast Cancer Analysis and Prediction

This project performs data analysis and applies machine learning models 
to predict breast cancer (Malignant vs Benign).

## Project Workflow
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering
4. Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
5. Model evaluation with metrics and visualizations
